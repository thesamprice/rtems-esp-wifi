 * by hand and grows one entry at a time as a source is added and asks for

 *
 * Written rather than generated on purpose.  A generated file would carry
 * several thousand CONFIG_ symbols, and the ones that matter would be
 * indistinguishable from the ones that do not.  Here every entry is present

 * what has actually been built.
 *
 * Anything absent is absent because nothing has asked yet.  A source that
 * needs a new one fails at compile time with the name in the error, which is
 * the behaviour wanted: a silently-zero CONFIG_ is how a feature gets built
 * out without anyone deciding to.

 * === wpa_supplicant ====================================================
 *
 * The supplicant's own feature macros -- CONFIG_IEEE80211W, CONFIG_WPS,
 * CONFIG_CRYPTO_INTERNAL and the rest -- are deliberately NOT here, and an
 * earlier version of this file that put them here was wrong in a way worth
 * recording, because the build did not complain.
 *
 * A #define here reaches a supplicant source only indirectly and only late:
 * utils/includes.h includes port/include/supplicant_opt.h, which includes this
 * file.  So it arrives below the first #include and nowhere above it -- and 11
 * of the 147 sources test a feature macro *above* their first #include.
 * src/crypto/ccmp.c is the clearest:
 *
 *     #ifdef CONFIG_IEEE80211W        <- line 9
 *     #include "utils/includes.h"     <- line 11
 *
 * The #include that would define the macro is inside the #ifdef the macro
 * gates, so the file can never switch itself on.  Measured, same flags, one
 * -D apart:
 *
 *     ccmp.o without CONFIG_IEEE80211W:   860 bytes, 0 defined symbols
 *     ccmp.o with    CONFIG_IEEE80211W:  5824 bytes, 8 defined symbols
 *
 * The 860-byte one was in libwpa.a, satisfying nothing, while rsn_supp/wpa.h
 * two directories over -- which includes sdkconfig.h at the top, before any
 * test -- saw the macro set and laid out structs that assume it.  That is not
 * a feature being off, it is two halves of one library disagreeing about a
 * struct, and no diagnostic says so.
 *
 * Upstream does not have the problem because it never puts them here:
 * components/wpa_supplicant/CMakeLists.txt passes them with
 * target_compile_definitions(... PRIVATE ...), once, to every file.
 * tools/supplicant-build.sh now does the same and carries that list.
 *
 * What belongs here is the layer above: the CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_* Kconfig choices
 * that upstream's CMakeLists translates into those macros.  They are recorded
 * as comments rather than #defines because nothing in this port reads them --
 * the translation is done by hand in supplicant-build.sh -- and a #define that
 * nothing reads is the same trap again.
 *
 * The choices, and what each costs:
 *
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_WPA3_SAE = n   (upstream default y)
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_WPA3_OWE_STA = n
 *       No WPA3-Personal and no Opportunistic Wireless Encryption.  Both need
 *       elliptic-curve arithmetic; see the crypto entry below for why that is
 *       not available yet.  A WPA3-only access point will not accept this
 *       station.  A WPA3-transition AP will, over WPA2-PSK, which is what
 *       CONFIG_IEEE80211W below is for.
 *
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENTERPRISE_SUPPORT = n
 *       No EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS, so no 802.1X network.  This is also why
 *       mbedtls_config.h builds no TLS and no X.509.
 *
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_MBEDTLS_CRYPTO = n   (upstream default y)
 *       The supplicant uses its own portable C crypto -- aes-internal.c,
 *       sha1-internal.c, sha256-internal.c, crypto_internal*.c -- rather than
 *       routing through mbedtls.  This is upstream's else-branch, not a
 *       hand-made combination, and for a PSK station it is complete: CCMP,
 *       the EAPOL-Key MIC, PBKDF2 and the RFC 3394 group-key unwrap are all
 *       there.
 *
 *       It is not a preference.  esp_supplicant/src/crypto/crypto_mbedtls.c
 *       is written against ESP-IDF's mbedtls *component*, not against
 *       espressif/mbedtls: it includes "mbedtls/esp_config.h",
 *       "mbedtls/ecp.h" and "mbedtls/bignum.h", and in mbedtls 4.x the last
 *       two exist only as mbedtls/private/.  All three are supplied by
 *       components/mbedtls/port/include, and esp_config.h in turn selects the
 *       ESP32 hardware PSA drivers (psa_crypto_driver_esp_hmac_opaque_contexts.h,
 *       absent here) and redefines the MBEDTLS_* set that libmbedtls.a was
 *       compiled with -- which would give crypto_mbedtls.o a different
 *       psa_hash_operation_t than the library it calls.  Turning this on means
 *       porting components/mbedtls/port first.  See docs/step6-supplicant.md.
 *
 *       The cost is speed, not capability: PBKDF2-SHA1 runs 4096 HMAC
 *       iterations in software once per association.  Nothing is lost to the
 *       ESP32-C3's AES and SHA peripherals either, because this port does not
 *       drive them -- the mbedtls built here is software as well.
 *
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SUPPORT = n
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_11KV_SUPPORT = n, CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_RRM_SUPPORT = n,
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_WNM_SUPPORT = n, CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_MBO_SUPPORT = n
 *       No access-point mode and no 802.11k/v assisted roaming.  A station
 *       still roams, it just does not get the neighbour report and BSS
 *       transition hints, so it decides when to move on signal strength alone.
 *
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DPP_SUPPORT = n, CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_NAN_USD_ENABLE = n,
 *   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_PASN_SUPPORT = n, CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_WPS_SOFTAP_REGISTRAR = n
 *       Wi-Fi Easy Connect, Wi-Fi Aware, pre-association security negotiation
 *       and the WPS registrar.  All upstream defaults, all off upstream too.
 *
 * CONFIG_IEEE80211W -- protected management frames -- is on, in
 * supplicant-build.sh with the rest.  Upstream defines it unconditionally, and
 * it matters here: WPA3-transition access points require PMF and a growing
 * number of WPA2-only ones are configured to, so a station without it fails to
 * associate with networks that look ordinary.
